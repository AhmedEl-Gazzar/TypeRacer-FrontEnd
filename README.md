# TypeRacer
This ReactJS app is a clone of the classic online browser-based typing game: typeracer.com

# Description
The Front-End code for my clone of typeracer.com shows my skills and knowledge of ReactJS, JSX(HTML), and CSS. To add on, the game mechanics need a developer with a concert understanding of state. Using several Hooks API’s, I was able to enforce constant state updates to allow the frontend to communicate though websockets with another player. Using a Socket.io implementation in the back-end, the front-end code had to consistently listen for and push out information regarding player’s progress, “words per minute, and more.

# Instructions 
- Click the "Enter a Typing Race" button
- If "Loading" appears, the game will start when another player joins
- Once another player joins, the game will start
- Type the underlined word to make your car move
- The first player to reach the end of the dashed, yellow line wins
- Once you finish race ends, the header will update to show the results of the race.
